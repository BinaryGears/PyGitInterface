# PyGitInterface
The aim of this program is to create a more user friendly interface to the git command prompt. This program is still far from complete. 
If you would like to contribute there are a few things that need to be completed.

1: All the commands for git need to work from this program in a user friendly way. 
2: We need to do more error handling and make the program worth using.

More plans are coming in the near future...
